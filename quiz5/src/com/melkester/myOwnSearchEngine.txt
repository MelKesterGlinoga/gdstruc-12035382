-data can be unsorted

-searches index 0 and the last index
-the function works their way towards the array
-if one of the search function finds the element it will return its' index

pseudo-code: 

// i hab working code in the Main.java

int start = 0;
int end = input.length - 1;

while (!neededElement)

for loop that sorts element from the start
inside the for loop, there is also a sorter but it starts at the end

if the element is found, it returns the index position
but, if the needed element isn't found it returns -1
